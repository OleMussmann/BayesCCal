This directory containts the code to generate the figures of the accompanying papaper. Some dependencies need to be installed:
- requests (for downloading the data files)
- scikit-learn (for the ML)
- pandas (for handling the data)
- matplotlib

The files are downloaded using the python script retrieveDatasets.py. You need to run this first (if you didn't do that yet).
After that, you can run genFigures.py.
